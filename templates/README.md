# RDForms templates

- In this directory we keep RDForms templates for common vocabularies that are ready for use or reuse.
- More RForms templates will be added over time when they mature.
- For information on how to use a template in a real setting see the samples directory.
- For information on how to use the formulator see the README in the parent directory under the heading "Constructing RForms templates".
