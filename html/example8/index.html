<h1>Example 8 - RDForm editor with field levels controlls</h1>
<div class="col1">
    <p>In RDForms we can specify the cardinality of fields in the template, e.g. the following editor uses a template where the title and description has a minimum cardinality of 1. These fields are therefore shown as mandatory. If a field has a preffered cardinality of 1 or higher it is considered recommended. If a field is neither mandatory or recommended it is optional.</p>
