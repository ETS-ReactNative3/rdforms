    <h1>Example 7 - RDForm editor with a registered chooser</h1>
    <div class="col1">
        <p>In RDForms we can pre-define the available choices to be rendered for a choice item either inline in the template
            or with a standalone (registered) chooser.
            We usually prefer the latter when the choices are not static or should be fetched by 3rd parties.
            In this example we use static data with a standalone chooser to showcase the concept. This chooser can easily
            modified to fetch dynamic data by modifying <a href="../chooser/chooser.js">chooser.js</a>.</p>
        <p>Note how the <i>Publisher</i> has different choices than the <i>Contact Point</i>, <i>Conforms To</i> or <i>Spatial
            Coverage</i>. The former choices are defined in <a href="../chooser/data.js">data.js</a> used by the standalone
            chooser
            while the rest uses the default "dummy" RDForm choooser's data.
            Also note that the chooser can render its own UI (e.g a pop-up or modal) to present and select the choice. The UI would be triggered
            when the search icon is clicked. Try clicking on the search icon for the <i>Publisher</i> field.</p>
